# Simple React.Js App Scaffolding

This is a simple and straight scaffolding of a small express.js based react app with webpack and hot module replacement plugin enabled.

Installation:

* git clone simple-react-webpack-hmre
* cd simple-react-webpack-hmre
* npm install
* npm start

If no PORT environment variable is provided, express starts at port 3000.

Thank you,
